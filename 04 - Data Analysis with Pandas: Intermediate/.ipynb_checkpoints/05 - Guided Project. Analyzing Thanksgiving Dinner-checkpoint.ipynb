    "In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and **analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US**. By the end, you'll have a notebook that you can add to your portfolio or build on top of on your own. If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook here. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found here.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset has **65 columns, and 1058 rows**. Most of the column names are questions, and most of the column values are string responses to the questions. Most of the columns are categorical, as a survey respondent had to select one of a few options. For example, one of the first column names is What is typically the main dish at your Thanksgiving dinner?. The potential responses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turkey\n",
    "* Other (please specify)\n",
    "* Ham/Pork\n",
    "* Tofurkey\n",
    "* Chicken\n",
    "* Roast beef\n",
    "* I don't know\n",
    "* Turducken\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the columns follow the same question/response format as the above. There are also **quite a few NaN values** in the columns, which occurred when a survey respondent didn't fill out a question because they didn't want to, or it didn't apply to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptions of some of the most important columns:\n",
    "* RespondentID -- a unique ID of the respondent to the survey.\n",
    "* Do you celebrate Thanksgiving? -- a Yes/No reponse to the question.\n",
    "* How would you describe where you live? -- responses are Suburban, Urban, and Rural.\n",
    "* Age -- resposes are one of several categories, such as 18-29, and 30-44.\n",
    "* How much total combined money did all members of your HOUSEHOLD earn last year? -- one of several categories, such as $75,000 to $99,999."
