    "psql is similar to the sqlite3 command line tool in that it allows you to connect to and manage databases. psql connects to a running PostgreSQL server process, then enables you to:\n",
    "* Run queries.\n",
    "* Manage users and permissions.\n",
    "* Manage databases.\n",
    "* See PostgreSQL system information.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "### REVOKE permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions can be removed using the REVOKE statement. The REVOKE statement enables you to take back any permissions given via the GRANT statement:\n",
