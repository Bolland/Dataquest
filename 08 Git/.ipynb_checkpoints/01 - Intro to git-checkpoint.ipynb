    "## Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging, git can't overwrite the changes in master with the changes from a branch that has forked at the same time as the already merged one because it doesn't know which changes are the \"correct\" ones. Git is designed to preserve everyone's work, so it won't cause a loss of effort by intentionally overwriting one person's commit with another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Git can't merge commits automatically, it informs the user of a merge conflict and asks them to sort it out. Sorting out a merge conflict involves editing the code that conflicts to create the \"correct\" version. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge feature/my-branch master #merges the feature branch into master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to resolve a conflict is to abort the merge altogether. We can do this with \n",
    "```bash \n",
    "git merge --abort\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mergetools\n",
    "\n",
    "https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool\n",
    "To useÂ a graphical merging tool we need to run the **git mergetool command**, along with the --tool option flag to specify which graphical tool to use. We can pull up a full list of available tools by running git mergetool --tool-help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keeping only one branch\n",
    "\n",
    "With some merges, we know that one branch has the \"correct\" changes, and want to ignore the other branch. We can keep files from one of the conflicting branches only by using git checkout with the --ours and --theirs options when we run into a merge conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, --ours will keep files from the current branch, and --theirs will keep files from the branch we're merging in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ignoring files\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some files that change very often, and aren't particularly useful to a project. One example is the .DS_Store file OS X puts in directories. Another is the .pyc files that Python produces when it compiles source files. Neither of these are necessary for the project to work properly, but because they change rapidly, they can create merge conflicts and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find default .gitignore configurations for several popular languages in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/github/gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing cached files\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned on the previous screen, adding files to .gitignore doesn't remove any files that have already been added to a Git commit. Git will still track changes to these files, and add them to future commits. This can be frustrating, especially when those files cause merge conflicts that require a lot of effort to resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove files from the Git cache with the git rm command and the --cached flag. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rm --cached .DS_Store\n",
    "```\n",
