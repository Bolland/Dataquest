    "Here are a few situations where data sets don't work well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data change frequently. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a data set of stock prices, for example, and download it every minute. This approach would require a lot of bandwidth, and be very slow.\n",
    "* You only want a small piece of a much larger data set. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to pull just your own comments from reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire reddit database, then filter it for a few items.\n",
    "* It involves repeated computation. For example, Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like these, an application program interface (API) is the right solution. An **API is a set of methods and tools that allows different applications to interact with each other**. Programmers use APIs to query and retrieve data dynamically (which they can then integrate with their own apps). A client can retrieve information quickly and effectively through an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# API Requests\n",
    "Organizations host their APIs on Web servers. When you type www.google.com in your browser's address bar, your computer is actually asking the www.google.com server for a Web page, which it then returns to your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work much the same way, except instead of your Web browser asking for a Web page, your program asks for data. The API usually returns this data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. We'll discuss JSON more later on in this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the requests library http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/ to send requests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GET Requests\n",
    "There are many different types of requests. The most common is a GET request, which we use to retrieve data. We'll explore the other types in later missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-notify.org/ offers several API endpoints. An **endpoint is a server route for retrieving specific data** from an API. For example, the **/comments endpoint** on the reddit API might retrieve information about **comments**, while the /users endpoint might retrieve data about users.\n",

In order to ensure that it remains available and responsive for all users, an API will prevent you from making too many requests in too short a time. We call this restriction **rate limiting**. It ensures that one user **can't overload the API server by making too many requests too fast**.\n",
