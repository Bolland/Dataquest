    "# Command Line Python Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at the command line Python interpreter in the last mission. The interpreter lets us run Python commands and see their results immediately. It's very useful for testing snippets of code quicky, as well as debugging. But it's not a good way to develop Python programs, because the commands aren't saved anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop Python programs, we'll need to make files containing Python code. Then we'll be able to use the interpreter to run them from the command line. This way, we can save all of our commands, but still see what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very common way to develop with Python -- use an IDE or text editor to create Python files, then run them from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a file that Python can execute on the command line by adding some lines of Python code to a blank file. Here's an example of Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to a Python script\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code works because the __name__ variable in Python scripts is automatically set to the name of the module. If the module is **being run from the command line, the __name__ variable will be __main__ by default**. Checking the __name__ variable allows us to tell whether a script is running from the command line or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are an important way to extend Python's functionality. We've worked with packages like matplotlib and pandas. The best way to install packages is to use the command line and a program called pip. The newest versions of Python include pip by default, so installing Python will automatically give you access to pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to install a package with pip, we just use `pip install`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`pip install requests`** will install the **requests package**, which developers use to **interact with websites and APIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## virtualenvs\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we had wanted to install requests for **Python 3 instead**? Different projects can require different packages and Python versions. This type of version switching can become confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, a computer system has **one python executable**, and we have to install all packages and libraries globally. This means that every single project on a machine has to use the same version of Python, and the same version of every package.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we can't use different versions of Python without some hacks. One such hack is renaming python to python3 so we can have access to both Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution is **for each project we write to have its own version of Python, along with its own packages**. This way, we don't need to worry that upgrading the version of a package will affect other projects on the system and cause them to stop working.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Virtual environments**, or virtualenvs, let us do this. We can **create a new virtualenv with the `virtualenv` command**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing `virtualenv main` will **create a virtualenv named main**. It will create a **folder in the current directory called main that will hold all of the packages we install** into the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create virtualenv \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, virtualenv will use the python executable when it makes a new virtualenv, which means that it has the **same version of Python as the system**. In this case, **we want to use python3 for our virtualenv** instead. In order to do this, we pass the **-p flag to the virtualenv command**, which will allow us to change the Python interpreter that virtualenv uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create python3 virtualenv:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n",
    "virtualenv -p python3 python3virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "To **activate virtualenv**, **run /bin/activate**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ". bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "(p3virtualenv) bbolland@PAV-NB-C02SNB6HG8WN:test/p3virtualenv $ python -V\n",
    "Python 3.6.1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternative:\n",
    "source /dataquest/system/env/python3/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find out **which version of Python we're using with `python -V`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also look up **which packages are currently installed** (along with their versions) with **`pip freeze`**. If we activate a virtualenv, all of the packages, including pip, **will be from the virtualenv instead of the main system Python executable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Run \n",
    "\n",

    "## Cross file scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about Python is that we can **import functions from a package into a file**. We can also **import functions and classes from one file into another file**. This gives us a powerful way to structure larger projects without having to put everything into one file\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's a file named `utils.py`, we can **import it into another file in the same directory** using `import utils`. All of the functions and classes defined in `utils.py` will then be available using dot notation. If there's a function called `keep_time()` in `utils.py`, we can **access it with `utils.keep_time()` after importing** it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we import the sys package, the argv list will allow us to retrieve the positional arguments passed into the script. We learned about positional arguments in the last mission -- they're the arguments that come after the command name. `python script.py 82` is one example. The first positional argument is script.py, and the second is 82.\n",
