    "Each scope can have any of three permissions (a scope can have multiple permissions at once):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **read** - The ability to see what's in a file (if defined on a folder, the ability to see what files are in a folder)\n",
    "* **write** - The ability to modify a file (if a folder, the ability to delete, modify, and rename files in the folder)\n",

The downside to symbolic notation is that if we want to change permissions, it takes a long time to type the changes out. We can do this more quickly by representing permissions with octal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Octal notation\n",

    "Octal notation allows us to represent the permissions for all scopes with just 4 digits, rather than the 10 characters involved in symbolic notation. There are **8 possible combinations of the three permissions r, w, and x**. We can express each combination, or scope, as a single digit in an octal (base 8) counting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the combinations and their corresponding digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* --- : No permissions; corresponds to 0\n",
    "* --x : Execute only permission; corresponds to 1\n",
    "* -w- : Write only permissions; corresponds to 2\n",
    "* -wx : Write and execute permissions; corresponds to 3\n",
    "* r-- : Read only permissions; corresponds to 4\n",
    "* r-x : Read and execute permissions; corresponds to 5\n",
    "* rw- : Read and write permissions; corresponds to 6\n",
    "* rwx : Read, write, and execute permissions; corresponds to 7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this system to convert the permissions string **-rw-r--r-- to 0644**. Just like with symbolic notation, don't worry about the first digit in octal notation right this second -- we'll get to it later.\n",
    "\n",
