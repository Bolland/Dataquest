    "We've defined a Player class and set up the default __init__ method to accept a data row as an argument. We made a deliberate choice to split up the logic of players and teams so our code is easy to read and maintain. We also made the convenient choice to initialize our Player instances using a data row. That's because all of the information is present in a row, and it will make it easier to create Player objects from the data set later on."
